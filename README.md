## Project Overview:
Goal: Develop a predictive model of homelessness at the community level using data from 2007-2023.
Focuses on approximately 400 Continuums of Care (CoC) that receive federal homeless assistance funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
Unique Focus: Unlike previous studies that predict homelessness at the individual level, this project centers on community-level factors.

## Data Sources:
Primary Data: Annual homelessness counts from HUD across CoC units.
Additional Data: Publicly available community-level factors such as rent rates, demographic and economic conditions, aggregated by CoC.
Timeframe: 2007 to 2023.

## Key Research Questions:
Moving beyond simply identifying associations between community-level factors and homelessness.
Objective: Predict the number or rate of homelessness in each CoC based on structural determinants like rent levels and economic conditions.

## Methodology and Tools:
Modeling Approach: Regression models or other predictive machine learning techniques.
Required Skills: Familiarity with regression models, feature engineering, and experience with the pandas and scikit-learn packages in Python.
