This file aims to present the shelter and permanent housing capacity data, specifically focusing on the "Total Year Round" beds for various housing types: Emergency Shelter (ES), Transitional Housing (TH), Safe Haven (SH), Rapid Re-Housing (RRH), and Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH).
The data includes separate indicators for each bed type, distinguishing between Households with Children and Households without Children, at the Continuum of Care (CoC) level. 
The analysis combines datasets from the 2014-2023 Housing Inventory Count (HIC) provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to create a new, comprehensive dataset featuring the required indicators. The source data can be accessed from the "2007-2023-HIC Counts by CoC" Excel file available online.
